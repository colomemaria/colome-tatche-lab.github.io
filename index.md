# Welcome to Colomé-Tatché Lab

We focus on single-cell multiomics, CNV detection, and computational biology.

Our lab is dedicated to developing and applying computational methods to understand biological systems at the single-cell level. We work on innovative approaches to detect copy number variations and analyze multiomics data to advance our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and disease mechanisms.
